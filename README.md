### Hello world, I'm Ody 👋

I'm a student, studying **Computer Studies** at [University of Peloponesse](https://www.uop.gr/). I am currently working on my thesis, which is a project that consists of a testbed implemented in *Docker*, a blockchain, a couple containers built for penetration testing and a network with a rule-setting API. One of my near future goals is to improve my python skills, in order to build a custom blockchain and enhance overall system's security.

I'm also a **Java Certified** Full Stack Developer of the **AFDEmp** Code Bootcamp at [PeopleCert](https://peoplecerteducation.org/bootcamp/).

## I am passionate about:

- Secure Protocols
- Linux Server Administration
- Penetration Testing
- Web Development
